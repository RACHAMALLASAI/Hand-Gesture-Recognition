# Hand-Gesture-Recognition

Designed a circuit to measure the amount of bending/deflection and also for recognition of Hand
gestures. 
In this project I have configured Arduino and used I2C module to connect LED Display to
Arduino.
Learned and experimented on flex sensors to know their measuring parameters in lab.
Designed a glove with flex sensors to know the hand gestures and bending of hand fingers.
Tested in real to understand the outputs.
